                    <p><b>Joomla!</b> is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) initially released in September 2005. Developed by <em>Open Source Matters Inc.</em>, it is built on a model-view-controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS and allows you to build powerful online applications.</p>

As someone with some technical skills, I was able to learn how to use the editing tools pretty quickly, I learned how to be a user administrator and set up permissions for our customer portal to allow ease of access for customer materials - the overall set up of these features was a very stress free process.</p>

                    <h5>Joomla for Developers</h5>
                    <p>Many companies and organizations have requirements that go beyond the basic Joomla! package, and in those cases, Joomla's powerful <b>application framework</b> makes it easy for developers to created sophisticated add-ons that extend the power of Joomla! into virtually unlimited directions. The core framework of Joomla! enables developers to quickly and easily build <i>inventory control systems, data reporting tools, application bridges, custom product catalogs, integrated e-commerce systems, complex business directories, reservation systems, and communication tools</i>. Since Joomla! is based on PHP and MySQL, you're building powerful applications on an open platform anyone can use, share, and support. To find out more information on leveraging the Joomla! framework, visit the <a href="https://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla! Developer Network</a>.
                    
                    <p>For live examples of Joomla! based sites, visit the <a href="https://showcase.joomla.org/">Joomla! Showcase Directory</a>.

                    <h2>Installing Joomla!</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="col-wide">
                    <p>Below are instructions on how to get started with Joomla!. You may also find more detailed information about installation and configuration <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Installing_Joomla" target="_blank">here</a>. Before successfully installing Joomla!, there are several prerequisites needed. Technical requirements can be found <a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/technical-requirements" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                   
                    <h4>Preparing for Installation</h4>
                    <h5>Download and Upload</h5>
                    <p><a href="http://downloads.joomla.org" target="_blank">Download</a> the current release of Joomla!. Use a FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Client to move the Joomla download package to your server and unpack it to install the files. Make sure you are using a FTP Client's official release to avoid running into errors or other problems.
                    <h5>Database Requirements</h5>
                    <p>If you need to create a database, you can read through <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Special:MyLanguage/Creating_a_Database_for_Joomla!" target="_blank">this</a> article first, or skip to the next step. You will need to note basic database information needed when the actual Joomla! installation has been initiated:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location of database, localhost, or a specific host's server such as <code>dbserver1.yourhost.com</code>
                        <li>Database name</li>
                        <li>Database user's name</li>
                        <li>Database user's password</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Starting the Installation</h4>
                    <h5>Configuration</h5>
                    <p>When the above requirements have been met, you are officially ready to install Joomla!. You can start the web installer by opening your browser and going to your site's domain name. On host installation, you will use <code>http://www.yoursitename.com</code>. If installing locally, use <code>http://localhost/&lt;path to Joomla files&gt;</code>, and you should see the installation screen.</p>
                    <h5>Fill in the Blanks</h5>
                    <p>Your <b>site name</b> can be changed at any point in the Site Global Configuration package. The <b>description</b> is a <em>global fallback</em> meta description used on every page, which will be used by search engines. Generally a maximum of 20-25 words is optimal, but this can also be changed in the Site Global Configuration page at any time. Enter a valid <b>email address</b> in case you forget your password. This is the email that will be used to reset or change the admin password. Make sure your password is strong and hard to guess. Administrators have maximum front and backend control of the site. <b>Site Offline</b> gives you the option to display a <em>'Site is offline'</em> message when you browse to <code>yoursitename.com</code> to view the homepage. If you select no, site will be live when you view the homepage.
                    <h4>Database Configuration</h4>
                    <h5>Configuration Settings</h5>
                    <p>During this section, you will need to enter information about the database you will use for Joomla!:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Database Type</b>: MySQLi is the common database used</li>
                        <li><b>Hostname</b>: Where is your database located? Common is <code>localhost</code>, but some hosts use a specific database server such as <code>dbserver1.yourhost.com</code></li>
                        <li><b>Username</b>: The username used to connect to the database</li>
                        <li><b>Password</b>: The password for the database's username</li>
                        <li><b>Database Name</b>: the name of the database</li>
                        <li><b>Table Prefix</b> One is generated automatically, but you can change it. For example, <code>jos3_</code> can be used. Just don't forget to put the underscore character (_) at the end of the prefix.</li>
                        <li><b>Old Database Process</b>: Should the installer backup or delete existing tables during the installation of new tables? Click, Yes or No to select the choice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These choices can be edited on the Site Global Configuration page after the installation has been completed. Making changes to these setting after installation will break the site unless you have a complete copy of the current database being used by the Joomla! installation.
                    
                    <h4>Sample Data</h4>
                    <h5>Install Sample Data</h5>
                    <p>If you are new to Joomla!, it will be beneficial to install <b>sample data</b> to see how Joomla! works. You can choose to have the configuration settings emailed to you. If the Email Configuration choice is selected, the Email Password choice will appear. The email password is off by default for security. You can choose to have the password included, click <b>Yes</b>. Afterwards, it will be time to check the configurations of your install and the environment of the installation.</p>
                  
                    <h4>Check the Configuration</h4>
                    <p>If everything is in order, you will see the installation at the top of the overview page. If not, this is the time to check what might be causing the issue.
                    <h5>Main Configuration</h5>
                    <p>All the website specific information, such as the website name, description, admin username, etc.</p>
                    <h5>Database Configuration</h5>
                    <p>Your database configuration contains the information about the database Joomla! will use.</p>
                    <h5>Pre-Installation Check</h5>
                    <p>These requirements must all be shown as Yes, otherwise you will not be able to install Joomla! With the exception of the PHP Version, the rest are usually controlled in the php.ini. You may need assistance from your host in correcting these settings or checking to see if it is possible to adjust them.</p>
                    <h5>PHP Settings</h5>
                    <p>Typical PHP settings might cause the install to fail and may need adjusting include the following with suggested values: (1) memory_limit (64M), (2)max_execution_time (300), (3) post_max_size (30M), (4) upload_max_filesize (30M). For more information, see the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php" target="_blank">PHP configuration file</a>.</p>
                    <h5>Recommended Settings</h5>
                    <p>These are settings are recommended in your PHP configuration, but will not prevent Joomla! from being installed. You can refer to the above instructions on how they may be changed.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Finalizing the Installation</h4>
                    <p>Congratulations! Joomla! should now be properly installed. If you'd like to start using Joomla! without installing any extra languages, there is one last step to really complete the installation: you <b>must</b> delete the Installation Folder. To do this, click on <b>Remove Installation folder</b> and a success message will appear. You can then navigate to the Administrator log in or go right to your site by clicking Site.</p>
                    <h5>Installing Languages</h5>
                    <p>To install <b>extra languages</b>, before deleting the Installation folder, click on <b>Extra steps: Install languages</b>. This will continue the installation of Joomla! by taking you to a new installation page. To choose a <b>default language</b>, when the download is complete, you can choose the default for the Site and Administrator interface. You may also choose to activate the multilingual features of Joomla! at this time too.</p>
                    <h5>Finalize</h5>
                    <p>You should now be presented with a congratulations page showing Joomla! has now been installed. The difference will be a notation of the Administrator and Site language settings if they were set. You will also not see the <b>Extra Steps</b> message in the bottom right. You can also delete the Installation Folder now.</p>
