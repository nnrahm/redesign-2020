            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>My name is Noshin Rahman and I am a designer focused on web development, illustration, and drawing. Creating unique, visual experiences and conveying emotions through art (with the help of coffee) is what keeps me working hard.</p> 
            <p>Coding has been a part of my creative flow since the era of <a href="www.xanga.com" target="_blank">Xanga</a> &mdash; it was just a fun hobby back then. If anyone told me in my teen years that I was to become a developer, I wouldn't have believed it. Since then, I have found coding to be the greatest way to showcase what I enjoy and do best today.</p>
            <p>Currently based in Oklahoma City, OK.</p>
